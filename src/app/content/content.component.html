    <p class="aboutPawl">AUSWL is a community created out of pure frustration over the anti-cheat absence of Call of Duty:
      Warzone. It is also a hub to find other passionate players looking for people to play with.</p>

        <h4>Find & play with new friends</h4>
        <p>Link up and engage with other Warzone players who are keen to expand their friend circle, and to say goodbye
          to filling their lobbies with randoms all the time.</p>

        <h4>Custom, competitive Warzone lobbies</h4>
        <p>We are all sick and tired of the cheating problem within Warzone. Our goal is to have whitelisted custom
          lobbies within the community for some fun but fair rivalry.</p>
